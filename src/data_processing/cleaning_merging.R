####NOTE##########
#Entity names in the original Acfrs database are not obvious, i.e., 
# They do not always contain a certain word to indicate its government type (i.e., city, town, county, etc). 

# *ACFRs data has government_id (which is called census_id in the ACFRs portal). 
# This is government unit identifier, and is not geo_id that are often used in many census datasets.
# 
# Two points above constitute challenges when we need to:
# 1) adding population field in acfrs data, and 
# 2) sort out what type of entities are collected.
# 
# * Two main ways to solve the problems: 
# - Use a "middle file" to link geo_id and government_ID
# - Joining by names and states
